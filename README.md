In this assignment, I chose to present the definition of the word "bounce" in a physical context in my code. So, I looked it up in encyclopedias and physics books. Combining the word's inherent meaning and its source, my initial idea was to present them in the middle of the screen using a typewriter-style animation (as demonstrated in tutorials). Then, after clicking the mouse, each word in the sentence would undergo free fall and bounce individually upon hitting the bottom.

I managed to showcase the bouncing effect in my assignment, but it didn't incorporate the realistic gravitational bounce effect, resembling more of a scenario in space. During this process, I encountered a significant issue. I couldn't figure out how to combine these two animations into a single object. The typewriter animation is designed for the entire sentence, while the bounce animation needs to work on each word separately. I couldn't find a proper way to transform my text from a sentence into individual words. Therefore, I ultimately presented the two animations separately. The words that appear in the bouncing animation are all the words obtained by breaking down the entire definition.
